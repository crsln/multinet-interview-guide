# HR Interview Questions - Non-Technical

> 7 HR interview questions with tailored answers and negotiation tactics

---

## Question 1: Tell Me About Yourself

### The Question
> "Tell me about yourself."

### Key Principles
- Keep it under 2 minutes
- Use Present-Past-Future structure
- Focus on professional journey
- Connect to the role you're applying for

### Your Tailored Script

```
"I'm a Senior Software Engineer with 10 years of experience, primarily focused
on banking and enterprise systems.

I spent 6 years at Veripark building core banking solutions with C# and .NET.
This gave me deep expertise in financial software development, transaction
processing, and working with complex business rules. I worked on products like
Veribranch and Veritouch, which are used by banks across the region.

After Veripark, I joined OSF Digital where I worked on international e-commerce
platforms using Salesforce Commerce Cloud. This experience taught me about
production support, working in distributed teams, and maintaining high-traffic
systems across different time zones.

Currently at Innovance, I'm working on a large-scale HR management system where
I lead feature development, handle database optimization, and manage production
issues. I work with Angular on the frontend and C# on the backend.

What excites me about Multinet is the opportunity to return to the fintech
and payments space where I have the most passion and experience. My banking
background, combined with my enterprise system experience, makes me confident
I can contribute meaningfully to your technology team."
```

### What to Avoid
- Starting with "My name is..." (they already know)
- A chronological history from childhood
- Being too modest or too boastful
- Taking more than 2 minutes

### Communication Tactics

- **Structure**: Present (current role) → Past (relevant experience) → Future (why this company)
- **Tailor**: Mention Multinet/fintech specifically
- **Quantify**: Include years of experience, company names

---

## Question 2: Why Are You Interested in This Company?

### The Question
> "Why are you interested in Multinet / this company?"

### Research Points About Multinet

```
COMPANY FACTS TO MENTION:
- Largest meal and shopping voucher network in Turkey
- Part of UP Group (international presence)
- 1.8 million card users, 60,000 contracted points
- Tech subsidiary Inventiv develops digital wallets, mPOS
- Recent products: MultiFlex app (2023), MultiPay wallet
- 552 employees, growing in fintech space
```

### Your Tailored Answer

```
"Three things specifically drew me to Multinet:

First, your position in the fintech ecosystem. You're not just a voucher
company anymore - you're building digital payment infrastructure with
MultiPay, MultiPOS, and the new MultiFlex platform. That's exactly the
kind of technical challenge I find exciting.

Second, my background aligns well. I spent 6 years at Veripark building
banking systems, so I understand the complexity of financial software -
compliance requirements, transaction integrity, and the need for high
availability. I'd be bringing directly relevant experience.

Third, the scale and growth trajectory. 1.8 million users, 60,000
contracted points - that's a real platform with real challenges. I'm
interested in working on systems that have meaningful impact, not just
toy projects.

I'm also drawn to companies that invest in their technology. The fact
that you have Inventiv as a dedicated tech subsidiary shows engineering
is a priority, not an afterthought."
```

### What to Avoid
- Generic answers that could apply to any company
- Mentioning salary, benefits, or short commute as primary reasons
- "I'm applying everywhere to see what sticks"

## Question 3: Why Are You Leaving Your Current Job?

### The Question
> "Why are you leaving your current job?"

### Key Principle
**Stay positive. Focus on growth, not grievances.**

### Safe Reasons Framework

```
GOOD REASONS:
1. Seeking growth opportunities not available in current role
2. Looking for new technical challenges
3. Want to return to a specific domain (like fintech)
4. Ready for more responsibility or leadership
5. Company circumstances (restructuring - not your fault)

BAD REASONS (never mention):
- "I hate my boss"
- "The company is terrible"
- "I'm not paid enough"
- Personal conflicts
```

### Your Tailored Answer

```
"I've had a good experience at Innovance - I've grown as an engineer and
contributed to meaningful projects. However, I'm looking for a few things
that are difficult to find in my current role.

First, I want to return to the fintech domain. My 6 years at Veripark
in banking software were the most engaging period of my career. HR systems
are interesting, but payments and financial technology are where my
passion is.

Second, I'm looking for more technical depth. At Innovance, I work across
many areas, which is valuable, but I'd like to specialize more deeply in
payment systems and transaction processing.

Multinet offers both of these - it's in the fintech space I love, and
it's large enough that I can focus on complex technical challenges while
still contributing to business growth."
```

### If Asked About Specific Issues

```
If pressed about any negatives, redirect:

"Every company has challenges - that's normal. What I focus on is whether
I'm growing and contributing. I've accomplished what I set out to do at
Innovance, and now I'm ready for the next challenge."
```

## Question 4: What Are Your Salary Expectations?

### The Question
> "What are your salary expectations?"

### Negotiation Strategies

**Strategy 1: Provide a Researched Range**

```
"Based on my research for Senior .NET Developer roles in Istanbul with
my experience level, and considering the scope of this position, I'm
targeting [X] to [Y] TRY monthly. However, I'm open to discussing the
complete compensation package including any bonuses, benefits, and
growth opportunities."
```

**Strategy 2: Defer Until You Have More Information**

```
"I'd like to understand more about the role's responsibilities and the
team structure before discussing numbers. Could you share the budget
range you have in mind for this position?"
```

**Strategy 3: Turn It Around**

```
"I'm flexible on compensation for the right opportunity. To give you a
meaningful number, what range have you budgeted for this role?"
```

### Negotiation Tactics

```
DO:
- Research market rates before the interview
- Consider total compensation (base + bonus + benefits)
- Ask about the budget range before giving your number
- Express flexibility while having a target
- Negotiate other elements if salary is fixed (remote days, vacation)

DON'T:
- Give a single number (always give a range)
- Accept the first offer without discussion
- Share your current salary if you can avoid it
- Apologize for your expectations
- Negotiate against yourself
```

### Turkey Market Context

```
Key factors in Turkish tech salaries:
- Istanbul pays highest, followed by Ankara
- Fintech/payments typically pays above average
- International companies or export-focused pay more
- Consider: net salary, meal cards, private health insurance,
  annual bonus, stock options (rare but growing)
- Ask about annual review/increase policy
```

### Your Preparation

```
Before the interview, know:
- Your minimum acceptable salary
- Your target salary
- Your "wow, yes!" salary
- Current market range for your role in Istanbul
- What non-salary benefits matter to you
```

## Question 5: Where Do You See Yourself in 5 Years?

### The Question
> "Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"

### Key Principles
- Show ambition but not that you'll leave quickly
- Connect your growth to company growth
- Be realistic about progression

### Your Tailored Answer

```
"In the next 2-3 years, I want to deeply understand Multinet's payment
infrastructure and become a go-to expert on the technical systems. I'd
focus on delivering high-impact projects and building strong relationships
with the team.

By year 5, I'd like to have grown into a technical leadership role -
whether that's a Staff Engineer, Tech Lead, or Architect position. I'm
interested in shaping architectural decisions and helping scale the
engineering organization as the company grows.

What attracts me to Multinet is that you're at an inflection point -
expanding your digital offerings, building new products. That creates
opportunities for engineers to grow with the company. I want to be part
of that journey and contribute to building something significant.

I'm also interested in the individual contributor track rather than
pure management. I want to stay technical while increasing my impact."
```

### What to Avoid
- "I want your job" (threatening)
- "I want to start my own company" (flight risk)
- "I hope to be at [bigger company] by then" (clearly temporary)
- Vague answers showing no ambition

## Question 6: What Is Your Greatest Weakness?

### The Question
> "What is your greatest weakness?"

### The Formula
**Real Weakness + Self-Awareness + Active Improvement**

### Good Weakness Examples for Developers

**Option 1: Time Estimation**

```
"I tend to be optimistic about how long tasks will take - I underestimate
complexity. I've gotten better at this by:

1. Breaking down tasks into smaller pieces before estimating
2. Adding buffer time for unknowns
3. Tracking my estimates vs. actuals to calibrate

For example, I used to estimate a week for features that took two. Now
I'm within 10-20% accuracy most of the time because I factor in testing,
code review cycles, and integration work."
```

**Option 2: Saying No**

```
"I sometimes take on too much because I want to help colleagues. Early in
my career, this occasionally affected my own deliverables.

I've learned to:
1. Assess my current capacity before committing
2. Propose alternatives instead of just saying yes ('I can help Thursday')
3. Be transparent about trade-offs with my manager

Now I'm better at protecting my focus time while still being a good
team player."
```

**Option 3: Public Speaking**

```
"Presenting to large groups has been challenging. I'm more comfortable
in small team discussions or 1:1s.

To improve, I've:
1. Volunteered to lead sprint demos (low-stakes practice)
2. Taken a presentation skills workshop
3. Started recording myself to identify verbal tics

I've progressed from avoiding presentations to actively seeking speaking
opportunities. My last architecture review went well, and I got positive
feedback on clarity."
```

### What to Avoid
- "I work too hard" (cliché, sounds fake)
- "I'm a perfectionist" (overused)
- Weaknesses that are deal-breakers for the role
- Claiming you have no weaknesses

## Question 7: Do You Have Questions for Us?

### The Question
> "Do you have any questions for us?"

### Always Ask Questions!
Not asking suggests you're not engaged or haven't thought about the role.

### Strong Questions to Ask

**About the Role:**

```
"What does success look like in this role after 6 months? After a year?"

"What are the biggest technical challenges the team is currently facing?"

"How does this role fit into the broader engineering organization?"

"What's the typical project lifecycle - from idea to production?"
```

**About the Team:**

```
"How large is the team I'd be joining, and how is it structured?"

"What's the development methodology - agile, scrum, something else?"

"How does the team handle on-call and production support?"

"What's the code review process like?"
```

**About Growth:**

```
"What does the career progression path look like for this role?"

"Does the company support conference attendance or learning opportunities?"

"Are there opportunities to work on different products or teams over time?"
```

**About the Company:**

```
"What's the engineering culture like at Multinet/Inventiv?"

"How does the technology team collaborate with product and business?"

"What recent technical decisions or projects is the team proud of?"
```

**Red Flag Detection (ask carefully):**

```
"What's the typical work-life balance like during normal sprints?"

"How long has the average team member been here?"

"What happened to the person who previously held this role?"
```

### Questions to Avoid

```
- "What does your company do?" (you should already know)
- "How much vacation do I get?" (too early, sounds lazy)
- "Can I work from home every day?" (wait for offer stage)
- Asking nothing at all
```

- Prepare your "Tell me about yourself" response
